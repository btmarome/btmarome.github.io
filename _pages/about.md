Hi! Welcome to my personal website.

I am a first-year Cognitive Psychology PhD student at the University of Chicago where I work with [Dr. Ed Awh and Dr. Ed Vogel](https://awhvogellab.com). Our lab investigates the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and selective attention using psychophysical and electrophysiological methods.

Before attending UChicago, I worked as a research assistant for [Dr. Barry Giesbrecht](https://psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/barry-giesbrecht), [Dr. Jonathan W. Schooler](https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/schooler/jonathan/members/schooler), and [Dr. Tommy Sprague](https://neuroscience.ucsb.edu/people/thomas-sprague), at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I graduated from UCSB in 2025 with a B.S. in Psychological & Brain Sciences and a minor in Philosophy. My previous [research projects](/projects/) investigated attention, working memory, mind-wandering and more!

## ðŸŽ“ For Future Grad Students

Curious about grad school? I've written an [honest advice guide](/thinking-phd/) for prospective applicants, which includes application tips, reflections from a first-gen applicant, and the timeline that worked for me.
