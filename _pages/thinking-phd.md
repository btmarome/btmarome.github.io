**Thinking about a PhD? You're not alone.**

Under constuction.

The creation of this website, along with my advice document to prospective PhD students, was heavily inspired by resources found on [Emma Megla](https://www.emmamegla.com/home)'s website.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to answer questions or review materials when I can.
