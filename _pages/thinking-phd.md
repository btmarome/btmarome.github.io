**Thinking about a PhD? You're not alone.**

This page shares honest advice, personal reflections, and resources that I hope will help prospective graduate students — especially those from non-traditional paths, first-gen backgrounds, or anyone unsure if they belong here (spoiler: you do).

## 💭 Why I Wrote This

When I was applying to PhD programs, I found myself swimming in forums, overthinking emails, and wondering if I was "PhD material." I wrote this guide to make the process a little more human.

## ✍️ Topics I Cover

- Choosing the right programs (and people)
- Emailing professors without overthinking it
- What I wish I knew before applying
- Being a first-gen or working-class applicant
- My application stats and materials (coming soon)

## 📬 Still Curious?

The creation of this website, along with my advice document to prospective PhD students, was heavily inspired by resources found on [Emma Megla](https://www.emmamegla.com/home)'s website.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to answer questions or review materials when I can.
