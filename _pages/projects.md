## Overview

My work on visual attention and working memory at the University of Chicago will begin in Fall 2025. Below are selected projects I’ve contributed to as a research assistant and lead undergraduate researcher at UCSB, grouped by lab and ordered from most recent to earliest.

## Psychological & Brain Sciences Honors Program — UCSB  

Evaluating ongoing thoughts during behavioral tasks can offer valuable insight into underlying cognitive processes. Yet, despite their ubiquity, dimensions of thought are often overlooked in experimental psychology, where researchers typically prioritize the assessment of task performance and neglect the accompanying mental experience. In this study, we used experience sampling to investigate the phenomenology of task-relevant thoughts during memory encoding for verbal and visual stimuli. By emphasizing the intricate relationship between external stimuli, inner experience, and memory encoding, this work calls for a more integrative approach that incorporates phenomenological perspectives in the study of cognition.

Then, they completed a digit span task to prevent information maintenance strategies in working memory. Finally, participants underwent a recognition memory test including previously studied stimuli and intermixed foils.*

## Memory, Emotion, Thought, and Awareness (META) Lab — UCSB  

Investigating the phenomenology of thought during memory encoding, with a focus on mind-wandering, image memorability, and recognition accuracy. Current projects use experience sampling and behavioral testing to understand how internal experience influences memory performance.

## Perception, Cognition, and Action (PCA) Lab — UCSB  

Exploring how visual working memory uncertainty is represented and reported using eye-tracking, behavioral measures, and EEG. Projects in this lab focus on spatial memory and moment-to-moment fluctuations in confidence and precision.

## Attention Lab — UCSB  

Projects in this lab examined value-driven attention and distractor timing across virtual and augmented reality environments. Employed EEG and behavioral analysis to understand how attentional capture operates under different sensory contexts.
